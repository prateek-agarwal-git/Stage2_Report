Our work evaluates several designs of the 5G user plane function (UPF) that leverage programmable dataplane hardware in different ways to improve performance. Our evaluation highlights the costs and benefits of each offload strategy, and provides lessons for future research in this area. We find that UPF offload designs proposed in prior work improve performance, but hurt flexibility in dynamic workload scenarios, and cannot process signaling traffic efficiently. To fully realize the power of programmable hardware offload for UPFs, we need to overcome the technical challenge of being able to parse complex 5G signaling messages in hardware. Our work is a first step towards using programmable dataplanes to realize the vision of 5G.
