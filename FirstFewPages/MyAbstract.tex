% This work presents a path planner for serial manipulators with large number of degrees of freedom, working in cluttered workspaces. Based on the variational principles, this approach involves formulating the path planning problem as constrained minimization of an energy based functional. The functional consists of terms representing the total joint movement and a measure of collisions over the complete path. We use semi-fixed boundary conditions at both ends of the trajectory to find more suitable start and end configurations. The concept of monotonic optimality is introduced in order to optimize the manipulator paths between the resulting end configurations. For obstacle avoidance, volume and proximity based penalizing schemes are developed. The presented planner uses a global approach to search for feasible paths and at the same time involves no pre-processing task. A variety of test cases have been presented and compared with another variational calculus based planner in order to establish the efficiency of the presented scheme in providing good quality paths.
