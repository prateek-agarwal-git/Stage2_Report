This portion of the problem statement took the maximum effort and time.
The inherited code was never cleaned and had various issues which are discussed below.

\section{Global Variables}
\subsection{Issue}
Around 150 variables, data structures were declared globally in ranMain.cpp. The use of 
global variables made the code highly coupled and made it difficult to change one procedure 
without affecting the other. Infact some of them were declared but never used. 
This made it also difficult to discern the scope of variable usage inside a procedure - whether is s global variable, 
local variable or a class member.
\subsection{Resolution}

\section{Directory Structure}
\section{Dead Code}
\section{Poor Refactoring}
\section{Unnecessary Offloads}
\section{Naming of Variables}
\section{Incorrect Stuff} argc == 0, Y(call X one times) , X 
\section{Technical Improvements}
High throughput of data plane latency packets.
\section{File Layout}
